<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Arman Hasan, a 10th class student from a middle-class background with a big dream to make learning easier and more accessible for everyone. Coming from simple beginnings, I always believed that knowledge should not be limited to a few, but should be free and open for all students and learners.</p>
<p>This website is a small step towards that dream. Through this platform, I want to provide free skills and resources to students and learners who want to improve themselves but may not have access to costly courses or paid tools. My aim is to make learning practical, easy to understand, and useful in real life.</p>
<p>I regularly update this website with new features, improvements, and content so that it becomes even more helpful. My vision is to build a space where students can learn new skills step by step in a simple and effective way, without feeling stressed or confused.</p>

<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>Like many students, I faced challenges in my journey – limited resources, financial struggles, and lack of proper guidance. But instead of giving up, I decided to use what I had and turn it into something meaningful. This website reflects that journey – a journey of self-learning, hard work, and the desire to share knowledge with others.</p>

<h2>My Vision</h2>
<p>With your support, I want to grow this platform into something bigger – a place where learning feels natural, interesting, and powerful. Together, we can create opportunities for those who need them the most.</p>
